I work on multiple things, here are some of them:

**[ðŸ§µSpinderok](https://github.com/oliverjarvis/spinderok)** is a react library created to facilitate super quick iteration for website designs. It's been created to bootstrap and replicate 99% of website designs 99% of the way. Requiring only fine tuning for the rest.
**[â›“Winch](https://github.com/oliverjarvis/spinderok)** is a react library created to add the most common website functionality. Designed to work in conjunction with Spinderok. Bootstrap and replicate 99% of website functionality 99% of the way.
**[ðŸŽ“Untitled](#)** A next generation learning platform, intending to facilitate ML education. Stay tuned.
