### Hej, I'm Oliver 👋🤖 
I'm a freelance data scientist and web developer #openforwork

I work on multiple things, here are some of them:

**[🧵Spinderok](https://github.com/oliverjarvis/spinderok)** is a react library created to facilitate super quick iteration for website designs. It's been created to bootstrap and replicate 99% of website designs 99% of the way. Requiring only fine tuning for the rest.

**[🎓Hackystacks](#)** A next generation learning platform, intending to facilitate ML education. Stay tuned.
